TODO: Velocity Controller - Implement precise stopping logic

Current Issues:
1. Velocity drops abruptly to 0 at endpoint causing jerky motion
2. Position accuracy at stopping point needs improvement
3. Current deceleration profile is not smooth enough

Requirements:
- Achieve smooth deceleration to zero velocity
- Maintain precise position control at stopping point  
- Minimize overshoot/undershoot

Proposed Solutions:
- Implement smooth velocity profile with proper deceleration curve
- Add lookahead to anticipate stopping point
- Consider adding PID control near stopping point
- Implement velocity ramp-down based on distance to target
- Add configurable stopping tolerance parameters

Implementation Notes:
- Need to modify VelocityController class
- Add new configuration parameters for stopping behavior
- Consider adding velocity profile generator helper class
