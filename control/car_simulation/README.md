# Vehicle Lateral Dynamics Simulation

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the physical meaning and practical applications of vehicle lateral dynamics equations with center of mass reference. Through simulation and visualization, it helps understand vehicle motion behavior during steering maneuvers.

## Core Equations

### 1. Lateral Force Balance Equation
```
m(v̇_y + v_x ψ̇) = F_yf cos(δ) + F_yr
```

**Physical Meaning:**
- Left side: Lateral inertial force at vehicle center of mass
  - `v̇_y`: Lateral velocity rate of change
  - `v_x ψ̇`: Centripetal acceleration due to yaw motion
- Right side: Total lateral force provided by tires
  - `F_yf`: Front tire lateral force
  - `F_yr`: Rear tire lateral force
  - `cos(δ)`: Cosine of front wheel steering angle

### 2. Yaw Moment Balance Equation
```
I_z ψ̈ = l_f F_yf cos(δ) - l_r F_yr
```

**Physical Meaning:**
- Left side: Inertial moment from yaw angular acceleration around center of mass
  - `I_z`: Yaw moment of inertia around center of mass
  - `ψ̈`: Yaw angular acceleration
- Right side: Net moment between front and rear wheels
  - `l_f F_yf cos(δ)`: Moment generated by front wheels around center of mass
  - `l_r F_yr`: Moment generated by rear wheels around center of mass

2. Linear tire model: F_y = -C_α × α
3. Rigid body assumption: Ignore body deformation
4. Flat road assumption: Ignore road inclination

- Tire linear operating region
- Low to moderate lateral acceleration
- Dry road conditions

## Precautions

1. **Simulation Accuracy**: Linear model has limited accuracy at large steering angles and high lateral accelerations
2. **Parameter Sensitivity**: Some parameter combinations may cause numerical instability
3. **Physical Constraints**: Need to ensure tire forces do not exceed physical limits
4. **Actual Validation**: Simulation results need to be compared and validated with real vehicle tests
