"""
Filter implementations for path tracking and control systems.

This package contains various filter implementations including:
- Kalman Filter: For linear state estimation
- Low-pass Filter: For noise reduction
- Moving Average Filter: For signal smoothing
- Complementary Filter: For sensor fusion
- Particle Filter: For non-linear state estimation
