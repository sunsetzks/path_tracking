## 🚀 Usage Examples

### C++ Usage
```cpp
#include "hybrid_astar.hpp"
using namespace hybrid_astar;

// Create vehicle and planner
VehicleModel vehicle(2.5, M_PI/4);
HybridAStar planner(vehicle, 1.0, M_PI/8);

// Set up environment
auto obstacle_map = create_obstacle_map(20, 20);
planner.set_obstacle_map(obstacle_map, 0.0, 0.0);

// Plan path
State start(1.0, 1.0, 0.0);
State goal(10.0, 10.0, M_PI/2);
auto path = planner.plan_path(start, goal);
```

### Python Usage
```python
import hybrid_astar_cpp as ha
import numpy as np

# Create vehicle and planner
vehicle = ha.VehicleModel(2.5, np.pi/4)
planner = ha.HybridAStar(vehicle, 1.0, np.pi/8)

# Set up environment
obstacle_map = ha.create_obstacle_map(20, 20)
obstacle_map = ha.add_rectangle_obstacle(obstacle_map, 5, 5, 10, 10)
planner.set_obstacle_map(obstacle_map, 0.0, 0.0)

# Plan path
start = ha.State(1.0, 1.0, 0.0, ha.DirectionMode.NONE)
goal = ha.State(15.0, 15.0, np.pi/2, ha.DirectionMode.FORWARD)
path = planner.plan_path(start, goal)

# Get statistics
if path:
    stats = planner.get_statistics(path)
    print(f"Distance: {stats['total_distance']:.2f}m")
```

## 📊 Performance Metrics
